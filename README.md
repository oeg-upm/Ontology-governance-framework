# Ontology Governance Framework

## Purpose and scope

This repository provides the materials 
developed for the **Ontology Governance Framework**, a conceptual approach for defining, organising, and assessing governance practices in ontology projects.

The framework is composed of three main elements:

---

## 1. Governance Mechanisms
Governance mechanisms represent the **Principles, Requirements, and Guidelines** that shape the decision-making process how an ontology should be designed, maintained, documented, and shared.    
These mechanisms can be adapted depending on the needs, maturity, and resources of a specific project or organisation.

---

## 2. Ontology Lifecycle
The **lifecycle** represents the temporal component. It defines the phases, activities and tasks for ontology development and evolution.  
It includes phases such as:
- requirements specification  
- development  
- integration  
- maintenance 


---

## 3. Roles
This component defines the **actors** and their **responsibilities** responsibilities involved in ontology governance.  
It identifies roles such as ontology engineers, domain experts, and software developers.
It helps clarify who does what, reduces ambiguity, and supports coordination within ontology projects.

## Included Materials

### 📝 Templates  
A set of templates is provided to help users **define and adapt their own governance models**, including:
- Template_Roles_Lifecycle_RACI.xlsx: Template for defining the roles, the lifecycle, and the RACI matrix. 
- template_diagram_lifecycle_roles_resources.drawio.xml: Template of the diagram representing the lifecycle. To be used with draw.io  

These can be customised to match the needs and context of different ontology projects.

### 📋 Questionnaires  
The questionnaires included in the repository support the definition and assessment of the governance and help collect feedback from practitioners.  
They can also be reused by teams who want to assess or refine their governance strategies.

### 📚 Use Cases  
The repository includes the documentation of **two use cases** (BME and STICS) where the framework is currently being applied.  
Each case describes:
- the domain and project context    
- the documentation developed through the application of the framework
